# py-stratego

This is my attempt at emulating the historically acclaimed strategy game Stratego. My grandpa is in his early 70's and has been playing his whole life - additionally, he has absoleutly no issue handing out Stratego punishments. I'll be modelling the game in pygame, potentially allowing for gameplay against another player. My main goal however is to design a single player gameplay expereince against the computer. 

At the moment I have very little plans for how a computer player will be implemented but I'm thinking I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. 

Lets get to it!
